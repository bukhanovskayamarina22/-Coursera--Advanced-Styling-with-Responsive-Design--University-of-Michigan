## Starting Point

**Large screen view**

Create a new look for screen sizes that are greater than 900px. It should look very similar to this:

In particular the properties that I want to see you change are:

a. Images are visible

b. Sections are next to each other

c. Additional text in/after the h1 (See how now it says “I guess”??)

**Print view**

Go back to the mobile view and print the page. Don't worry if you don't actually have a printer, you can use "Print Preview" or "Print as pdf."

If you are using CodePen some of the CodePen code will show up as well, don't worry about that. All we care about is that a few things are changed, namely:

a. The h1 heading is set to 1em (instead of being big)

b. The navigation links are not styled as much (you need to figure out which parts have changed)

c. The images are gone

d. The background color is removed
